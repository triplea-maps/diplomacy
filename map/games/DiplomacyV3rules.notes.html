						<br>By Veqryn
						<br>
						<br>Claim 18 of the 34 VC to win.
						<br>
						<br><b>You may not produce any units if you do not control at least 1 of your Beginning 3 factories.</b>
						<br>
						<br>A scenario built for a game with no permanent alliances.
						<br> v3/aa50 rules. ***a few extra rules are found below....
						<br> #1.limit yourself to 5 minute turns, negotiate on other people's turns not yours. try to play quickly.
						<br> #2.only 1 person can win, so conduct your diplomacy accordingly.  If you do get backstabbed, try to be a good sport, and do not take it personally, everyone should backstab and be backstabbed eventually. 
						<br> #4.have fun! (place your bids in a balanced fashion...diplomacy sometimes fails!  do not be a bad sport! suiciding yourself IS being a bad sport.).
						<br> #5.because there are lots of players, there is a chance someone will disconnect. meet back in the lobby and start your game up again with the latest autosave. be patient. don't leave, thats just lame!
						<br>
						<br> @Optional Rules:
						<br> @house rules are subject to the host of the game's approval.
						<br> #1. No Buying Tech Tokens for first 3 rounds.   <- optional, less tech spam
						<br> #2. Gunboat Diplomacy.   <- optional
						<br> #3. Anything everyone agrees on Before game starts.   <- optional
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>Notes:
						<br>Battleships do NOT repair.
						<br>Purchasing units and collecting money happen every OTHER turn.
						<br>Players do not get to steal a player's PUs when they capture a capital.
						<br>You may not produce any units if you do not control at least 1 of your Beginning 3 factories. (this is to compensate for having no capital)
						<br>
						<br>Skagerrack and The Baltic Sea touch each other, there is no sea zone between them. (The to the east of Denmark is really just part of Denmark)
						<br>Kiel touches the Baltic Sea.
						<br>
						<br>There are 2 canals:
						<br>The Black Sea to The Aegean Sea requires control of Constantinople
						<br>The Baltic Sea to Heligoland Bight requires control of Kiel
