						<br>Claim 20 of the 34 VC to win.
						<br>This is a team game, unlike the other Diplomacy versions it is not a free for all.
						<br>Recreate WW1 as the Triple-Entente vs the Central Powers.
						<br>
						<br>You may not produce any units if you do not control at least 1 of your Beginning 3 factories.
						<br>The Fleet in St. Petersburg starts in the SOUTH COAST
						<br>
						<br>read why this is important below:</b>
						<br>
						<br>This map follows similar rules to the actual board game "Diplomacy"
						<br>For now it is as close as we can come to the game using the TripleA engine.
						<br>To see which territory is "Sea/Ocean" then turn on "map details" (map reliefs).
						<br>
						<br><b>Some general rules:</b>
						<br>In order to transport an Army over water, you must have a Fleet for each Army you wish to transport, and for each sea zone you wish to 
							transport them over, and the Fleets may not move during this turn.
						<br>So for example, if I wish to transport 3 Armies from London to Norway, then I must have at least 3 Fleets in the North Sea.
						<br>If I want to transport 3 Armies from London to Portugal, then I must have at least 3 Fleets in the English Channel AND at least 3 Fleets in the Mid-Atlantic 
							(To accomplish this, switch to Edit mode, then click on the "Action" Tab on the right, then move the units by CTRL + Clicking in each sea zone along the way).
						<br>Those fleets must be there at the START of the turn, and they may not move during the entire turn. (So if I transport 3 Armies from London to Denmark, 
							and I have 5 Fleets in the North Sea, than 3 of the Fleets may not move, but I may move the other 2 Fleets because they are not busy transporting.)
						<br>
						<br>
						<br><b>Very Important Clarifications about the Map:</b>
						<br>There are 3 types of territories: Land, Sea, and Coastal
						<br>Brest and Spain are examples of Coastal territories.  A Coastal territory is a land territory that touches the Sea.
						<br>Armies can enter Land and Coastal territories.  Armies may NOT enter Sea territories.
						<br>Fleets can enter Sea and Coastal territories.  Fleets may NOT enter Land territories.
						<br>This does mean that Fleets and Armies can fight each other, but only in Coastal territories.  This is intended.
						<br>
						<br>Coastal Territories and Fleets follow special rules:
						<br>A fleet can logically only move through water.  It can not cross land to occupy another coastal territory.
						<br>So for example, a fleet in Rome may not move to Venice or Apulia.  It may move to any adjacent coastal province, such as Tuscany and Naples, as well 
							as any connected Sea territory.
						<br>
						<br>Some Coastal Territories have more than one Coast:
						<br>Bulgaria (East Coast, and South Coast)
						<br>Spain (North Coast, South Coast)
						<br>St. Petersburg (North Coast, South Coast)
						<br>
						<br>What this means is that a fleet occupies a specific coast, while it occupies the entire territory.
						<br>So for example, a fleet in the north coast of spain occupies all of spain, but it can only move to Gascony, Mid-Atlantic, and Portugal.  It may NOT 
							move to Western Med or Marseilles or Gulf of Lyon.
						<br>If the Coastal territory has multiple "coastlines" then the owner of the fleet must announce to all players which "coastline" his fleet is occupying.
						<br>
						<br>Certain Areas of the map are waterways:
						<br>Kiel has the Kiel Canal, meaning that any fleet may move to or from Kiel to the Baltic Sea, Denmark, Berlin, Heligoland Bight, and Holland.
						<br>Constantinople has The Bosphorus and Dardenelles, meaning that any fleet may move to or from Constantinople to the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, Ankara, 
							Smyrna, Bulgaria East Coast, Bulgaria South Coast.
						<br>
						<br>Sweden and Denmark are connected, any Army or Fleet may move to or from Sweden to Denmark in one turn.
						<br>The Baltic Sea and Skagerrak are NOT connected.  A fleet moving from the Baltic Sea must move first to either Sweden or Denmark.  Sweden does not have 
							separate coastlines.
						<br>
						<br>
						<br><b>Other Rules:</b>
						<br>Players do not get to steal a player's PUs when they capture a capital.
						<br>Make ALL your moves during 'Combat Move' and not during 'Non-Combat Move' (because you may not be allowed to move through dummy territories you do not control).
						<br>Purchasing units and collecting money happen every OTHER turn.
						<br>You may not produce any units if you do not control at least 1 of your Beginning 3 factories. (this is to compensate for having no capital)
						<br>
						<br>Optional Rule: You may only produce units at your beginning factories.
						<br>So for example, France would only be able to produce units at Brest, Paris, and Marseilles.  This is true even if she controls the entire map.  This is 
							also true if she loses control of these three factories.  If she loses control of these three factories then she can not produce any units until she 
							gets them under her control again. (This is an optional rule).

						<br>Thank you Pulicat for your suggestion on the territory connection dummies.
						<br>Thank you Bung for helping make white fonts and making the roads skin version (IL).
						<br>
						<br>PS: do not use the AI on this map. the ai will move units to dummy territories that the humans can't get to :P
